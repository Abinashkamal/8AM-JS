Context: 

Context is used to make some data available globally to all the 
components in the application.


Generally, Any data that needs to passed to other components, props 
should be used , however we need to send props to each level till 
we reach the target component. This is where Context is helpful. 
Context allows the target component to access the data directly without 
passing through props on every component.
