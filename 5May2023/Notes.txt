Redux:

Redux is a application state management library used to maintain 
the global data which can be accessible through out the application.

Redux entities: 

Store: contains the application data/state

root reducer: it is responsible for preparing the application state/data and provide it to Store.

reducer:  provides the data to the root reducer.

action:  makes connection to data sources and get the data, provide data to reducer

container: It is a component that interacts with redux. Generally, users interact with Container for 
performing any action.


Container -> action -> reducer -> root reducer -> store (data)

component -> container -> conect function and connects to store and access the data.
