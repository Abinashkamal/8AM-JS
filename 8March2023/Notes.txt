First Class Functions:

In JS, Functions are treated as first class citizens hence these functions 
in JS are called as First class functions. 

A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.
