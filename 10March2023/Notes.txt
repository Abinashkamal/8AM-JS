Problem Statement:


part 1:
Make an API call using XMLHttpRequest to https://fakestoreapi.com/products

Step 1:  Make api call and handle the response in onreadystatechange event.

Step 2:  convert the data from string to javascript array. 

        var products =  JSON.parse(http.responseText)

Step 3:  use while / for loop - iterate the list of products and display each product on the UI with 
the following details. 

title , price and image (<img src="+image+">)
