Component: 

In React, A component is used to provide / create a functionality that contains 
the logic and ui of the feature. 

ex: Login, Register, ChangePassword, ForgotPassword. 

syntax: 
 
  function Component_Name(parameters){

     // logic 

     return(
          // add UI Content
     )

  }

  To use the component, we need to use the component name as tag name. 

  <Component_Name></Component_Name>
