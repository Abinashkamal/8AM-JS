Composition vs Inheritance:

Inheritance: It is for reusability where a class extends another class 
to reuse the existing functionality. 

class A{

}
class B extends A{

}

Multiple Inheritance:

class A{

}
class B{

}
class C extends A,B{ // ERROR - Multiple Inheritance is not supported in ES6

}



App -> SearchBar, VideoList, VideoPlayer 


class SearchBar{

}
class VideoList{

}
class VideoPlayer{


}
class App extends SearchBar,VideoPlayer, VideoList{ // drawback


}

Composition:

Composition is also for resuability of code however it does not extend classes. 


class SearchBar{

}
class VideoList{

}
class VideoPlayer{


}
class App{
   SearchBar;
   VideoList;
   VideoPlayer;
}
So, Composition is more feasible than Inheritance, hence React chose Composition over Inheritance.
