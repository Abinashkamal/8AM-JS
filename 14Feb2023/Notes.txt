Scripting Languages and their usage:

A Scripting Language is always interpreted and will never be compiled. 

In JS, we will write the code and provide it to browser for execution, 

Any errors w.r.t will be shown in the developer's console. 

There are many Scripting Languages such as JavaScript, ActionScript, 
Php, Python etc.. 

Getting Started with JS:


We use script tag to add JS Code. We can add JS code either in head or 
in body section. 

<html>

<head>

    <!-- <script>

        alert("Good Morning!");
        console.log("Hello Everyone!!");

    </script> -->

</head>

<body>

    <script>

        alert("Good Morning!");
        console.log("Hello Everyone!!");

    </script>

</body>

</html>

We can also add JS code in a seperate file and then we can use it in HTML. 

index.html:

<html>

<head>

    <!-- <script>

        alert("Good Morning!");
        console.log("Hello Everyone!!");

    </script> -->

</head>

<body>

    <script src="index.js">
    </script>

</body>

</html>


index.js:
alert("Good Morning!");
console.log("Hello Everyone!!");
