Code Splitting: 


Once the application is developed, before deploying the application to the server,the following process 
is followed. 

1. The complete application (js files) is bundled in a file called bundler.js. 

There are lot of bundlers available in the market such as web-pack, browserify..

If the bundler.js file becomes too big, then the initial load of the page takes lot of time which is not 
considerable.

Bundling process promotes the early loading of the content. To handle this, we need to perform lazy loading.
